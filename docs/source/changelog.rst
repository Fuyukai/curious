---------------------------

 - :class:`.VoiceState` now uses a property reference to the User object.

 - Add :meth:`.HTTPClient.get_mentions`.

 - Add :attr:`.BotUser.authorized_apps` which returns an async iterator
   that can be used to get the authorized apps for this bot.

 - Add :meth:`.BotUser.get_recent_mentions` and

   mentions.

 - Change statuses to new :class:`~.Presence`, which are stored on Member
   and RelationshipUser instances.

 - :attr:`.Guild._large` is now set by GUILD_SYNC handling for userbots.

 - Optimize :meth:`.State.make_message` slightly, by checking the cache
   before editing it.

 - :meth:`._prepare_request` automatically stringifies all items in the
   query string before sending it.

 - Add search support:

    - :meth:`.HTTPClient.search_channel` and
      :meth:`.HTTPClient.search_guild` are the raw HTTP methods for
      searching.

    - :class:`.SearchQuery`, :class:`.SearchResults` and
      :class:`.MessageGroup` are the high level wrappers for searching.

 - Add :meth:`.AsyncIteratorWrapper.next` and
   :meth:`.AsyncIteratorWrapper.all`.

 - Change :class:`~.Guild` objects on dataclasses to mostly look up via
   property or weak reference rather than having a strong reference.

 - Change commands:

    - A callable that takes ``(bot, message)`` and returns (a) prefix(es)
      to match can now be provided for ``command_prefix``.

    - Functions are unwrapped for the `.factory` attr if possible.

 - Add the ability to listen to multiple events with one function.

   :class:`~.NotificationLevel`, :class:`~.ContentFilterLevel`, and update

 - Add :attr:`.Channel.nsfw`.

0.3.0 (Released 2017-03-10)
---------------------------

 - :meth:`.Client.start` will now automatically reboot shards that return.

 - Add :meth:`.HTTPClient.get_authorized_apps` to get the authorized apps for
   this account.

 - Add :meth:`.HTTPClient.revoke_authorized_app` to revoke an application's
   authorization.

 - Add :meth:`.BotUser.get_authorized_apps` as the high-level equivalent.

 - Add :attr:`.Message.channel_id` and :attr:`.Message.author_id` to access
   the raw IDs from Discord, even if the message author or channel is not
   cached.

 - Unprivatize :meth:`.State.find_channel` and add
   :meth:`.Client.find_channel` to use this method.

 - Unprivatize :meth:`.State.is_ready`.

 - Change sharding slightly:

    - :meth:`.Client.boot_shard` will boot one shard and add its gateway
      to the internal list.
      This will allow finer control over shard booting.

    - :meth:`.Client.start` will now use ``boot_shard`` to load a shard, so
      overriding it in a subclass can customize shard creation.

 - The client will now wait for the gateway to be ready before firing any
   events.

 - Add :class:`.BotType` to more finely control how bots are defined.

 - Add :attr:`.EventContext.event_name`, :attr:`.EventContext.handlers`.

 - Add :attr:`.Client.events_handled` and :attr:`.Gateway._dispatches_handled`
   to show how many events have been handled during the lifetime of the bot.

 - Add :class:`.GuildStore` which tracks the order of guilds for user bots,
   and can be used to return the guilds in that order.

 - Change :class:`.Channel` for group DMs slightly:

    - New attributes have been added: :attr:`.Channel.owner`,
      :attr:`.Channel.owner_id`, :attr:`.Channel._icon_hash`,
      :attr:`.Channel.icon_url`.

    - :attr:`.Channel._recipients` has been added to replace ``recipients``
      as the backing store, and is now a dict.

    - Correspondingly, :attr:`.Channel.recipients` is a mapping proxy for
      ``Channel._recipients``, and can be used to access the recipients of
      the channel.

 - Add :meth:`.HTTPClient.update_user_settings` to update the settings of a
   user.

 - Add :class:`.UserSettings` to represent the settings of a user.

 - Add event handler for ``USER_SETTINGS_UPDATE``.

0.2.1 (Released 2017-02-23)
---------------------------

 - Sync/chunk guilds when a ``GUILD_CREATE`` is received during the main bot
   lifecycle.

 - Decache users automatically when a ``GUILD_DELETE`` is received.

 - Fix the default role not being accounted for in permissions.

 - Fix ``GUILD_ROLE_DELETE`` handling.

 - Fix async threads hanging the bot on shutdown.

 - Add the ability to set ``afk`` in a presence change, to allow self-bots to
   not eat notifications.

 - Userbots will now ask for member chunks and then sync guilds once all
   chunks are received.

 - Make :attr:`.Guild.large` a property rather than an attribute.
   Discord doesn't always send this properly, so fallback to
   ``member_count >= 250``.

0.2.0 (Released 2017-02-20)
---------------------------

 - Add user account logging in support.

 - Add :attr:`~.State._friends` and :attr:`~.State._blocked` to
   :class:`.State` to represent the friends and blocked users a client has.

 - Add :attr:`~.BotUser.friends` and :attr:`~.BotUser.blocked` properties to
   :class:`.BotUser` which can be used to access the State's attributes.

 - Add a new type called :class:`.RelationshipUser` which represents either a
   friend or a blocked user.

 - Rearrange channel and guild handling in ``READY`` parsing.

 - Fix :attr:`~.Channel.author` inside private DMs being wrong sometimes.

 - Allow group DMs to work properly.

 - User cache has been redesigned:

    - Users are now cached indefinitely in :attr:`~.State._users`.

    - Users are referred to by property on :class:`.Member` rather than by
      storing them.
      This should reduce some memory usage as duplicate members will no longer
      store multiple instances of a user.

    - Users are only decached on a guild member remove.

 - :meth:`.State.make_user` now takes a ``user_klass`` param which allows
   customization of the user class created when caching a user.

 - Users are now updated in ``PRESENCE_UPDATE`` rather than
   ``GUILD_MEMBER_UPDATE``.

 - ``GUILD_SYNC`` is now supported for user bots.

 - Creating :class:`~.HTTPClient` with ``bot=False`` will send a user
   authorization header rather than a bot authorization header.

 - Add :meth:`.HTTPClient.get_user_profile` to get a user's profile.

 - Add :meth:`.HTTPClient.get_app_info` to get the application information
   for a specific app.
   This method will attempt to download the bot information alongside the
   app - failing this, it will only request the basic app info scope.

 - Remove :meth:`.HTTPClient.get_application_info`; call ``get_app_info``
   with ``None`` to get the current app's info.

 - Add :meth:`.HTTPClient.authorize_bot` to authorize a bot into a guild.

 - Move :class:`.AppInfo` into its own module.

 - Make :class:`.AppInfo` more useful than just the current application's
   info.

 - Add :attr:`~.AppInfo.bot` attribute to :class:`~.AppInfo` which returns
   the bot user associated with this app.

 - Add :meth:`.AppInfo.add_to_guild` which authorizes a bot into a guild.
   Only user accounts can call this.

 - Add :meth:`.Client.get_application` to get an :class:`AppInfo` object
   referring to an application.

 - Add :meth:`.HTTPClient.send_friend_request`,
   :meth:`.HTTPClient.remove_relationship`,
   :meth:`.HTTPClient.block_user` for editing relationships with users.

 - Add :meth:`.User.send_friend_request`, :meth:`.User.block`,
   :meth:`.RelationshipUser.remove_friend` and
   :meth:`.RelationshipUser.unblock` to manage relationships between users.

 - :class:`.BotUser` cannot send friend requests to itself or block itself.

 - Add :meth:`.User.get_profile` to get a user's profile.

 - :meth:`.Embed.set_image` now validates that the link is a HTTP[S] link.

0.1.4
-----

 - Add :class:`.Widget` for support of widgets.

 - Add widget support inside the HTTPClient.

 - Fix events inside cogs.

 - Add new error code mapping to :class:`.HTTPException`.
   This provides clearer display as to what went wrong when performing a
   HTTP method.
